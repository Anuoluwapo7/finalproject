    <p>A prevalent trend in this data is the continents Africa and Asia having the most refugees. This is because of two main things. Africa is made up of a collective of third-world countries that consistently deal with infrastructure issues and curropt governments. Asia, on the other hand, is in competition with Africa mainly because of three countries, Burma, also known as Mayanmar, Iraq, and Bhutan. These three countries were consistently dealing with civil wars mainly over government, religion and freedom.</p>
